# APS_CPU

Created for subject Architectures of Computer Systems at FIT, CTU.

# Project Description
Design a simple 32-bit processor connected to a separate instruction and data memory. The processor has to implement instructions from RV32I Base Integer Instruction Set. Suppose that the processor starts the execution from the beginning of instruction memory (0x00000000).

To test if designed CPU works as intended write a program that will loop through an array of numbers and determine if the given number is prime. If there is a prime number in the given position in the array that position is set to 1 otherwise to 0.
